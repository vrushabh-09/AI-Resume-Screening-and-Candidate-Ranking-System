# 📄 AI Resume Screening and Candidate Ranking System

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Identifying relevant candidates from a large pool of resumes is a tedious task for recruiters. Manually screening profiles is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Moreover, deserving candidates might be overlooked due to inconsistencies in resume formatting. This system aims to streamline resume screening and ranking to ensure fair and efficient hiring.

### 🎯 Motivation
- **Reduce recruiter workload** by automating the screening process.
- **Ensure top talent is not missed** due to inconsistencies in resume structuring.
- **Enhance fairness** in hiring by ranking candidates based on job relevance.

## 🏆 Proposed Solution
Our AI-powered resume screening system utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Machine Learning (ML)** to:
- Extract skills, experience, and relevant qualifications from resumes.
- Compare candidates’ profiles with the job description.
- Rank candidates based on relevance scores.
